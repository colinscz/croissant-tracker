# What is the Croissant Tracker? 🥐
Croissant Tracker is a fun and delicious way to encourage punctuality in your team, office, or friend group. Based on the popular European tradition where latecomers bring pastries for everyone, this app helps you keep track of who owes croissants and ensures no debt goes unforgotten!

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Someone's Late
When someone arrives late to a meeting, event, or work, add their name to the tracker.

### 2️⃣ Croissant Debt Created
The system automatically tracks that they owe croissants to the group.

### 3️⃣ Croissants Delivered
When they bring the promised croissants, mark the debt as delivered!


## 🇫🇷 The Tradition
The tradition of bringing pastries when you're late is common in many European workplaces, particularly in France, Germany, and other countries. It's a lighthearted way to acknowledge lateness while treating your colleagues to something delicious.

While croissants are the classic choice, the tradition can include any pastries, donuts, or treats that bring joy to the team. It's not about punishment—it's about building camaraderie and encouraging punctuality in a fun way!
